All the translations can be updated on this page.

## Translations Categories

We separate translations into 4 categories:

- **Default**
- **Nodetype**
- **Relationship**
- **Widget**

Then for each category, we have the category options. For example, if you choose the nodetype category, the category options will be all the nodetypes in your datamodel. You would then be able to see the translation for each property and each language. *(See image above)*
